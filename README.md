# GitHub Actions â€“ Next.js Build with Caching & Artifacts ðŸš€

This workflow automates the **build process** for your Next.js application and uploads the built files as **artifacts**. It also uses **caching** to speed up dependency installation on subsequent runs.  

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

1. **Automatic build on push** â€“ Runs whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch.  
2. **Node.js environment setup** â€“ Configures Node.js and caches `npm` dependencies.  
3. **Build the Next.js app** â€“ Runs `npm run build`.  
4. **Upload build artifacts** â€“ Saves the output folder (`out/`) so it can be downloaded later or used in other workflows.

## ðŸ“‚ Workflow File

```yaml
name: Next JS Build with Caching & Artifacts

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]  # Trigger workflow on pushes to main branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout repository
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4.2.2

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js environment with caching
      - name: Setup Node JS
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4.2.0
        with:
          node-version: 22.x
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Build Next.js app
      - name: Build Next Js App
        run: npm run build

      # Step 5: Upload build artifacts
      - name: Upload Build on Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4.6.0
        with:
          name: nextjs-build
          path: out/   # Directory containing the built app


ðŸ”¹ How it Works

Checkout Repository â€“ Pulls your code into the runner.

Setup Node.js â€“ Installs Node.js version 22.x and enables caching for npm dependencies to speed up future runs.

Install Dependencies â€“ Installs all Node.js packages listed in package.json.

Build Next.js App â€“ Runs npm run build, which creates a production-ready build.

Upload Artifacts â€“ The out/ folder is uploaded as a workflow artifact. You can download it from the workflow run page or use it in subsequent workflows like deployments.




âš¡ Benefits

Faster builds thanks to dependency caching.

Safe storage of build artifacts for deployment pipelines.

Automated workflow ensures builds are consistent and reproducible.
